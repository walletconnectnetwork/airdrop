What is the WalletConnect Network?

The WalletConnect Network enables secure and effortless connections between mobile wallets and applications. This ensures that when users engage with an on-chain app — be it by scanning a QR code from a desktop or connecting directly via a mobile device — WalletConnect establishes a reliable connection between the wallet address and the app. With features such as QR code scanning and one-click mobile connections, WalletConnect plays a crucial role in empowering users to access and interact with decentralized applications (dApps).
